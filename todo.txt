Write time to the display on boot? Won't really help if it can't write...
Send network ping somewhere on boot (to alert to cyclical system restarts)
.. if image refresh succeeds in less than x seconds (indicates display is not connected)

add healthchecks integration

don't queue if multiple track changes come in together (or make a queue, but with max depth=1)

Support multiple anniversaries on the same day



I want to define in config a 'health_script', which will accept param1=good/bad and param2 "$additional_info". This script, if defined, should be called when display renderssuccessfully or non-successfully, i.e. at the same time as you do or do not log 'ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: FAST DISPLAY RENDER DETECTED! ðŸš¨'. We should record the health status somewhereaccording to the last time a render completed, and in the main event loop we should re-call the health script with the same params used the last time if it is >30 minutes since the last health script call.
